    sonar readings back to `control`. If `n` is zero, then independent IR
    readings should be streamed back to `control` until `control` sends a
    command to stop.

    If `raw` is `True`, then the raw ADC output is streamed back to `control`
    rather than the approximated distance as calculated by `rover`.

    If `rand` is `True`, then readings will not be taken as often as possible.
    Rather, one each reading should delayed by a random amount of time before
    being taken.

    If `timestamps` is `True`, then timestamps indicating when a reading was
    taken are streamed back to `control` along with the readings themselves.
