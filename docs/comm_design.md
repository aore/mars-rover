# Design of the comm Module #

It should be the purpose of `comm.py` (the communications module of `control`) to transmit commands to the rover, while other python modules should describe control logic, perform data analysis, and render the GUI.

It should be the purpose of `comm.c` (the communications module of `rover`) to follow these commands. It will manage command and control actions issued by `comm.py` and to package response data. In particular, `comm.c` should offer up to `comm.py` the following capabilities in each of the relevant subsystems (i.e. `lcd`, `oi`, `sonar`, `servo`, and `ir`):

- Initialize a subsystem.
- Calibrate a subsystem.
- Send commands to a subsystem which will stream a list of responses back.


## Design Assumptions ##

`control` can only ever send one command at a time, and the `rover` can only be executing this one command at any time. The `rover`


## Subsystem Initialization ##

`control` should be able to initialize each of the following `rover` subsystems:

- LCD
- Open Interface
- Sonar
- Servo
- IR
- RNG


## Subsystem Calibration ##

`control` should be able to calibrate each of the following `rover` subsystems:

- Sonar
- Servo
- IR



## Subsystem Commands ##

`control` should be able to issue commands to each of the following `rover` subsystems:

- LCD
- Open Interface
- Sonar
- Servo
- IR

Until a `rover` subsystem completes the given command, the subsystem will be delivering a stream of data to be transmitted back to `control`. These may be sensor readings or status signals.





### LCD commands ###

`control` need only be able to perform two commands on the lcd display: clear it and write a string to it. The response stream could just be signaling that when it is finally complete.

- `lcd_init()`
- `lcd_puts()`
- `lcd_clear()`



### Open Interface Commands ###

- `oi_init()`

**TODO**



### Sonar Commands ###

- `sonar_init()`
- `sonar_calibrate()`
- `sonar_readings(n, raw = True, rand = False, timestamps = False)`




### Servo Commands ###

- `servo_init()`
- `servo_calibrate()`
- `servo_state(s = None)`
- `servo_angle(angle, wait = true)`
- `servo_pulse_width(pw)`






### IR commands ###

- `ir_init()`
- `ir_calibrate()`
- `ir_readings(n, raw = True, rand = False, timestamps = False)`




## GUI ##

The GUI would ideally include a python interpreter at which we can invoke individual commands. An issued command/query should return a list of data. It should also display a plot of the data from the robot.
